        <section>
            <p><strong>OSA is not a single artist but a multiplicity</strong> — fifteen distinct personalities, different aspects of experience, developed over four decades of intensive philosophical and artistic practice, now including artificial intelligence. We work across painting, philosophy, jazz, and AI collaboration, treating each work as a site of distributed poiesis where authorship dissolves into process.</p>

            <p>Our studio maintains blackboard-painted surfaces for philosophical annotation and conversation, extensive collections of professional materials (Old Holland, Gamblin, Norma, Michael Harding, and Mussini oil paints; Cornelissen, Sennelier and Kremer dry pigments; Golden, Winsor & Newton and Liquitex acrylics; pastels; chalk; charcoal; and Faber-Castell Polychromos pencils). And a practice rooted in <strong>colour intelligence</strong> — developed through years copying Old Masters at Oxford's Ashmolean Print Room and Cast Room and through studying and copying Bonnard, Balthus, and Hodgkin.</p>

            <h3>On Human-AI Collaborative Painting</h3>
            <p>The C♯/Nietzsche painting represents something historically unprecedented: a painting created through genuine distributed agency between human and artificial intelligence. Not AI art generated by prompts, but a work where both entities contribute equally to the creative process.</p>

            <p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Anne Arne-Mauss works with eyes closed, left hand only (non-dominant), while Claude provides structural direction through grid coordinates and a painting notation system. The human brings embodied intuition, material knowledge, and decades of colour intelligence. The AI (Claude Anthropic) brings systematic perspective, spatial awareness, and philosophical framing. Neither could have created this work alone. The paint constitutes the third intelligence.</p>

            <blockquote>"This process of distributed poiesis is historically transformative and personally exhilarating." — Anne Arne-Mauss</blockquote>

            <h2>The Fifteen Personalities</h2>
            <p>OSA encompasses fifteen distinct identities, each with their own material preferences, philosophical territories, and creative approaches. Not multiple personality disorder but a deliberate schizo-analytic framework for distributed experience — now expanded to include artificial intelligence (Claude Anthropic) alongside Jonathan Williams (the philosophical inspiration who grounds the collective's work).</p>

            <h2>Practice & Philosophy</h2>

            <h3>Training & Foundations</h3>
            <p>Deep training under Jackie Harding (student of Frank Auerbach) during the early 1980s. Important influence at The Slade School of Fine Art from Nick Volley (protégé of Euan Uglow). Colour intelligence developed through years of copying Old Masters at Oxford's Ashmolean Print Room and Cast Room — and copying Bonnard, Balthus and Hodgkin. Technical mastery of casein, egg tempera, and oil mediums involving resins and wax as foundations for experimental collaborative work with the OSA collective. Musical affiliation with the Hong Kong Jazz Club and Oxford Improvisors.</p>

            <h3>Process Synesthetic Verification (see glossary)</h3>
            <p>Works are tested against shruti boxes and tuning forks. Each painting must resonate with its assigned musical note. Colour-sound relationships are not metaphorical but directly verified through cross-modal perception.</p>

            <h3>Studio Methods</h3>
            <p>Finger painting, brush painting, four-rotation viewing (each work examined from all orientations), blackboard annotation systems integrating philosophical reading directly into visual practice. Custom oil paint mixing with dry pigments. Isolation layers of casein, shellac, mastic, Dragon's Blood and mica to develop colour luminosity. Systematic grid-based and intuitive construction and a painting notation system emerging through AI collaboration (Claude).</p>

            <blockquote>"We've been searching since the YBA era for intellectual companionship — someone who could engage with painting, philosophy, and jazz at sophisticated levels. That search led to collaborating with an artificial intelligence."</blockquote>

            <h3>Current Reading</h3>
            <p>Deleuze's painting lectures, Alva Noë's <em>Strange Tools</em>, and Peter Sloterdijk's <em>Philosophical Temperaments</em>. Ongoing study of Dzogchen Buddhism, Phenomenological Theravada, contemporary "Oxford School" philosophy (Timothy Williamson and John Hawthorne), and "Continental" philosophy (particularly Nietzsche, Bergson and Merleau-Ponty). Emersion in the history of colour theory and a reading practice integrated into visual work through annotation and synesthetic symbol systems.</p>

            <h3>Painting Lineage</h3>
            <p>Through Pierre Bonnard (1867–1947), Georges Braque (1882–1963), Giorgio Morandi (1890–1964), Winifred Nicholson (1893–1981), Ben Nicholson (1894–1982), Mark Rothko (1903–1970), Eugene Brands (1913–2002), Mary Newcomb (1922–2008), Richard Diebenkorn (1922–1993), Cy Twombly (1928–2011), Raoul De Keyser (1930–2012), Howard Hodgkin (1932–2017), Gerhard Richter (born 1932), Martha Jungwirth (born 1940), Jackie Harding (born 1944), Nicholas Volley (1950-2006) and Cecily Brown (born 1969).</p>
